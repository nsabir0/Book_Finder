If anyone want to read a physical book but he/she can’t find it at his nearest book shops or library then this application will help them to get their desired book. With the help of this application anyone can buy any physical book by himself or online order from any book shop all around our country. On the other hand, this app is very beneficial for a book shop owner. Because with the help of this app he can publish his book collection, find new customer or buyer and sell his books online. A book seller will give his all information about books and library and also his contact info, which will help a buyer to decide whether he want to physically buy the book or by online order. Moreover, nowadays almost everyone reads e-book on their digital devices because of the struggle to find a physical book, and we all know the importance of reading a physical book rather than an e-book. So, this app will help everyone to reduce the struggle and read physical books easily. A buyer can communicate with the seller by calling him with the provided phone number which will help them to discuss how they are going to buy the book and so on.
